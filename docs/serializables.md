# Serializable Classes

To create a serializable class, just annotate it with `@serializable` and mixin
`Dataclass<T>`. The code generator will then generate the required structure definition of
your class.

!!! example "Explore Code Snippets"
    You can explore the code in codeblocks by expanding comments using the floating (+) button.

``` { .dart .annotate }
@serializable /*(1)!*/
class Person with Dataclass<Person> /*(2)!*/ {

  final String name;
  final int age;
  final Set<String>? tags; /*(3)!*/
  
  Person(this.name, this.age, this.tags); /*(4)!*/
  
}

@serialzable // (5)!
enum MyEnum { 
  a,b,c;
}
```

1. The serializable annotation is required to make a class serializable.
2. The dataclass mixin is optional but recommended, as it provides **equals**,
**hashCode** and **toString** implementations.
3. DOGs natively supports `List<T>` and `Set<T>` for any serializable type. While the field
itself is allowed to be null, the elements of the iterable must not be null.
If you require nested nullability, consider using the `Optional<T>` type.
4. You constructor must only reference serializable fields and must not be private.
You can also use a secondary constructor for serialization by naming it `dogs`.
5. You can also annotate enums to make them serializable.
Enum values will be serialized and deserialized as strings using their name.

## Conformities
Not every serializable class must be semantically equal to this dataclass example.
Besides the initially presented dataclass, DOGs also supports the following other
conformities:

=== "Dataclass"

    ``` dart
    @serializable
    class Person with Dataclass<Person> {
    
      final String name;
      final int age;
      final Set<String>? tags;
    
      Person(this.name, this.age, this.tags);
    }
    ```
    
    Dataclasses are the most common type of serializable classes. They are immutable
    and their fields should be final. They are also the only type of serializable class
    you should use when you require equality.

=== "Dataclass (named args)"

    !!! tip "Named Argument Constructors"
        You can also use named arguments with you dataclass constructor. This is especially useful
        when you have a lot of optional fields or many fields with the same type.

    ``` dart
    @serializable
    class Person with Dataclass<Person> {

      final String name;
      final int age;
      final Set<String>? tags;
    
      Person({
        required this.name,
        required this.age,
        this.tags
      });
    }
    ```

=== "Basic"

    ``` dart
    @serializable
    class Person {
    
      String name;
      int age;
      Set<String>? tags;
    
      Person(this.name, this.age, this.tags);
    }
    ```
    
    If you don't use the dataclass mixin, the generator will not generate equality and hashcode
    implementations for this structure and you will have to implement them yourself if required.
    Since the generator doesn't expect this class to be immutable, you can use mutable fields
    and setters with this type of serializable class.

=== "Beans"

    !!! danger "Prefer other conformities like Dataclass!"

    ``` dart
    @serializable
    class Person {
    
      late String name;
      int? age;
      Set<String>? tags;
    
      @beanIgnore
      late String ignored;
    
    }
    ```

    Beans are the most flexible but also the most error prone type of serializable class.
    Serializable fields must be mutable and have a public no-arg constructor.
    They are only intended for frameworks which benefit from such a structure for simplicity.
    
    To instantiate a bean, you should use the generated `{name}Factory` class with its 
    static `create` method.

## Modifications

You can use the automatically generated builder to modify serializable classes easily.
Depending on your prefer code style, you can use either the imperative or lambda builder.

=== "Lambda Builder"

    ```dart
    var built = person.rebuild((builder) => builder
      ..name = "Alex"
      ..age = 22
    );
    ```

=== "Imperative Builder"

    ```dart
    var builder = person.toBuilder();
    builder.name = "GÃ¼nter";
    builder.age = 25;
    var obj = builder.build();
    ```

!!! note "Availability"
    The builder is only available for dataclasses and basic serializable classes.
