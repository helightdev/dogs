The dogs_form extension is a Flutter package designed to expand the capabilities of the dogs_core
package. It focuses on automating the generation of forms by using dogs generated class structures.
The package is integrated with the flutter_form_builder to enhance its functionality, making it
easier and faster for developers to incorporate form-building features into Flutter
applications. Whether you want to simply create a fast prototype or build a fully polished app,
dogs_forms got you covered.

## Easy to refactor
Your form description is getting to big or you want to use a more tailored widget for a specific
field? No problem, just create a custom factory and use it instead of the default one. You don't
have to rewrite the whole form in order to change fields.

## Automatic validation
The package automatically validates the form based on the dogs_core validation rules and provides
the form with the appropriate error messages.

## Usage

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Additional information

TODO: Tell users more about the package: where to find more information, how to
contribute to the package, how to file issues, what response they can expect
from the package authors, and more.
